## Abstract
Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) form the foundation of modern electronic systems, and ensuring their quality is critical in manufacturing. Manual inspection of PCBs is time-consuming, prone to error, and inefficient at scale. This project presents an automated PCB defect detection system using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. The model was trained on a labeled dataset of PCB images containing various types of defects, enabling it to accurately identify and localize issues such as open circuits, mouse bites, spurs, and more. To enhance accessibility and usability, we developed a web-based application that allows users to upload PCB images and receive real-time defect detection results. The system performs inference using the trained YOLOv5 model and visually marks defects on the uploaded image. This integration of deep learning and web technologies provides a fast, accurate, and user-friendly solution for PCB inspection in both industrial and academic settings.
